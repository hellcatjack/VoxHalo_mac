# Changelog

All notable public changes to VoxBridge are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Measure consecutive VAD silence and cancel energy-only endpoints when Silero
  confirms resumed speech. Keep unfinished Chinese Qwen endings in the same
  decoder state across short pauses; sustained silence and Stop still finalize.
  Independently verified whole-segment corrections retain prompt publication.
- Disabled Zipformer switching in capture UI and rejected legacy XL requests
  before model loading; retained offline research assets and adapter tests.
- Added local Chinese Qwen decoder/pending-text diagnostics with production
  off/shadow modes. Smaller adaptive clauses remain benchmark-only after real
  audio exposed cross-segment duplication; that adaptive policy remains disabled.

- Hardened shared HLS listening with shared unpublished translated-audio backlog,
  server-side global Auto speed control, playhead-aligned captions, and guarded
  historical-silence compaction. Browsers consume the same audio at media rate
  1.0x; device buffering and playhead positions remain independent. Compaction
  requires available next-speech metadata and a safe media target; it cannot
  remove a wait for speech that has not yet been published.
- Coupled the Q8_0 llama.cpp translation API to the VoxBridge user service with
  PID supervision, model-aware readiness checking, ordered startup, and
  propagated stop/restart operations.
- Prevented high-confidence quiet speech from being discarded by the energy
  decode gate by adding an opt-in Silero decode rescue that cannot cut segments
  or commit text. Rescue now uses accumulated evidence across a coalesced batch,
  so speech at the beginning is retained even when trailing silence lowers the
  batch mean. Confirmed speech at the end of a batch now vetoes an energy-only
  endpoint; trailing silence still uses the existing VAD endpoint thresholds.
- Replaced hard-overflow PCM deletion with bounded WebSocket ingress waiting;
  temporary inference and segment-finalization stalls now apply transport
  backpressure instead of removing spoken audio.
- Preserved uncommitted text across hard cuts that occur before the configured
  VAD silence endpoint, including stable clauses emitted with a provisional
  terminal boundary.
- Preserved real spoken text around consecutive streaming-context echoes;
  pure context-only hallucinations remain excluded from translation and TTS.
- Instructed both translation directions to omit only non-semantic speech
  disfluencies while preserving meaningful interjections and source content.
- Added a locally hosted hls.js MSE fallback for desktop Chrome, Edge, and
  Firefox while preserving native Safari HLS for iPhone lock-screen playback.
- Added explicit desktop MSE AAC capability detection and a near-silent idle
  carrier so hls.js never waits on table-only MPEG-TS segments.
- Bounded `partial` and `final` compatibility snapshots to the latest 100
  solidified rows while retaining complete canonical backend state, preventing
  long meetings from serializing the full transcript on every partial update.
- Increased the measured single-stream hard backpressure budget to 15 seconds
  so a one-time ROCm/GTT allocator expansion does not discard live PCM.
- Corrected the bounded HLS caption timeline to use FFmpeg PCM sample positions,
  AAC presentation delay, synthesized-speech activity bounds, and Safari's
  device-local program date. This removes the roughly two-second early caption
  display and prevents stale device playlists from selecting newer server cues.
- Retained the previous Live Audio sentence between cues without making advisory
  caption polling a dependency of lock-screen audio.
- Prepared exact translated-sentence revisions on the existing single Kokoro
  worker while the backend stability gate is still active, then reused only an
  exact cache hit at ordered HLS release. Revised text invalidates stale audio,
  preparation never publishes early, and the bounded cache is listener-scoped.
- Collapsed the bounded current-session TTS backlog to its latest stable
  translation when the first HLS listener joins, so late listeners start at the
  live edge instead of replaying the meeting from the beginning.
- Counted in-flight Kokoro work in HLS queue diagnostics and logged synthesis
  latency, audio duration, and real-time factor without recording translated text.
- Exposed synthesized PCM backlog as `pending_audio_ms` and added a non-skipping
  listener live-edge guard so slow playback cannot accumulate unbounded delay,
  including while an iPhone page is locked.
- Prevented untranslated Han text from leaking into English subtitles or TTS;
  built-in translators now make one strict target-language retry and reject a
  still-mixed result without blocking later translations.
- Repaired compatible streaming sentence-tail omissions at each segment final
  before source commit, translation, and TTS publication; failed or divergent
  validation no longer causes immediate TTS sealing.
- Prevented the newest unsealed source from reaching TTS on a timer before its
  segment-level canonical ASR validation or rollback-safe successor exists.
- Prevented context hotwords from becoming subtitles after long client silence
  by requiring backend speech evidence before post-silence output is accepted.
- Prevented control-only silent sessions from invoking streaming ASR finish and
  publishing context-biased empty-audio hallucinations.
- Preserved rollback-deferred text across VAD state rotation when the next
  segment correctly begins without textual overlap, eliminating a deterministic
  whole-sentence drop before translation.
- Allowed high-similarity final tail repairs from speech-confirmed segments to
  survive the context silence guard, restoring weak sentence-final syllables.
- Preserved short pauses and sub-120 ms stop tails while suppressing only
  confirmed long-silence transport spans.
- Preserved a bounded 400 ms low-energy endpoint tail and decoded any backend
  pre-roll that had never reached ASR before segment finalization, preventing
  weak final syllables from being discarded at client-silence cuts.
- Prevented Kokoro playback from speaking a translated sentence revision that
  is superseded inside the backend revision-stability window.
- Added newest-source-only TTS revision grace and backend segment sealing so
  late model corrections are protected without a global seven-second delay.
- Prevented mid-speech hard cuts from blocking on full-segment re-decode and
  overflowing the live audio queue.
- Prevented fuzzy candidate-cursor remapping from consuming a newly completed
  terminal sentence after segment resegmentation.
- Rejected segment-final corrections that reduce complete units either inside
  the current segment or after carrying its predecessor's pending prefix,
  preserving stable streaming tails across VAD finalization.
- Rejected canonical candidate updates that move a material suffix of the
  preceding sentence into the current sentence ID, preventing overlapping
  duplicate rows after segment-final resegmentation.
- Prevented a single segment-final one-shot decode from shortening an already
  solidified sentence to its strict normalized prefix, preserving stable final
  words observed throughout the streaming decode.
- Disabled blocking full-session Stop re-decode by default so normal Stop keeps
  visible subtitle history and no longer emits `sentence_reset`.

### Added

- Added a [main-branch handoff record](docs/releases/2026-09-12-main-handoff.md)
  for the local Qwen-only deployment, guarded endpoint fix, deferred experimental
  adaptation, and unchanged listener behavior. The latest macOS Chrome user
  observation is not presented as an iPhone playback verification.
- Added a public, English-only PCCS listener that always fits one viewport, plus
  a locally generated QR on the authenticated main page for the listening URL.
- Added a default 128-lease cap to public HLS bearer capabilities while retaining
  one shared Kokoro worker and one FFmpeg encoder for every listener.
- Replaced per-sentence browser WAV playback on `/listen` with one public
  continuous AAC/HLS live stream, allowing native iPhone lock-screen playback
  and many bounded listeners without per-device Kokoro or FFmpeg work.
- Added listener-scoped HLS listener leases, bounded translated-speech and PCM
  queues, Media Session lock-screen controls, and a user-gesture retry path for
  iOS playback policy failures.
- Added optional `--segment-final-redecode` with structured latency/result
  probes for segment-level canonical ASR validation.
- Added a YouTube `json3` reference-coverage diagnostic for likely whole-cue
  gaps, aligned final-suffix gaps, duplicate commits, and translation ID gaps.
- Added ordered `audio_silence` and `audio_speech_start` WebSocket messages,
  400 ms client pre-roll, source-timeline accounting, and Chromium/WebKit tests.
- Applied a shared, anti-hallucination ESV terminology policy to both
  Chinese-to-English translation backends.
- Added optional CPU-only Kokoro-82M speech for fully stable translated
  sentences, with backend source-order jobs and strict browser FIFO playback.
- Added authenticated in-memory TTS audio jobs, acknowledgement/cancellation,
  TTL cleanup, and default-off browser controls.
- Added a multi-listener `/listen` broadcast page
  with per-device FIFO playback and one shared Kokoro synthesis per translation.
- Decoupled translated-speech playback from the main subtitle page; listener
  Start and Stop now affect only that device.
- Disabled raw Uvicorn access logging so opaque TTS job identifiers are not
  persisted in request paths; broadcast diagnostics use short hashes instead.
- Added a bounded vLLM multimodal processor cache option and the user-level
  `voxbridge-logrotate.timer` deployment templates for long-running sessions.
